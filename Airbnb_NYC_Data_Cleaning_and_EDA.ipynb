    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provides detailed information about thousands of listings across New York City, including price, location, room type, availability, and host details.  \n",
    "The goal of this project is to *clean, preprocess, and explore* the dataset to uncover meaningful insights about the short-term rental market in NYC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. *Data Cleaning*  \n",
    "   - Handle missing values and inconsistent entries  \n",
    "   - Detect and address outliers (e.g., unrealistic prices)  \n",
    "   - Ensure data types are properly set for analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  \n",
    "   - Understand the distribution of prices across neighborhoods and room types  \n",
    "   - Explore host behavior and availability trends  \n",
    "   - Visualize correlations between numerical features  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Insights & Future Work*  \n",
    "   - Provide actionable insights about Airbnb listings in NYC  \n",
    "   - Lay the groundwork for potential predictive modeling (e.g., price prediction, occupancy forecasting)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Project?\n",
    "Data cleaning and EDA are the most time-consuming yet crucial steps in any data science workflow. By transforming raw Airbnb data into a structured, visual, and interpretable format, this project demonstrates strong *data preprocessing skills* and the ability to extract valuable insights for decision-making.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### üìå Observations:\n",
    "- *Price*  \n",
    "  - The majority of listings fall within a reasonable range, but a significant number of extreme values exist.  \n",
    "  - A few listings report prices as high as *$10,000*, which are likely unrealistic or rare luxury properties.  \n",
    "  - Boxplot clearly shows these as isolated points far above the interquartile range (IQR).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Minimum Nights*  \n",
    "  - Most listings have values under 30 nights.  \n",
    "  - However, some records report extremely high values, including up to *1250 nights* (over 3 years), which is impractical for real-world rentals.  \n",
    "  - Around *14 listings exceed 365 nights*, suggesting possible data entry errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Reviews per Month*  \n",
    "  - The majority of listings receive between 0‚Äì5 reviews per month.  \n",
    "  - Some listings show extreme values, up to *58 reviews/month*, which could represent unusual popularity but may also be anomalies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö† Why Outliers Matter\n",
    "Outliers can distort statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) and may bias machine learning models. For example:\n",
    "- The average price becomes inflated due to a few unrealistic values.\n",
    "- Distribution plots lose interpretability when extreme values dominate the axis scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Next Step\n",
    "In the following step (1.10), we will *handle these outliers* using capping or filtering strategies (e.g., limiting price to a maximum of 1000 and removing records with minimum_nights > 365).  \n",
    "This will help ensure the dataset better reflects realistic Airbnb market conditions in New York City."

    "### üìå Outlier Handling Strategy:\n",
    "- *Price*:  \n",
    "  - Listings with prices above *1000 USD per night* are considered unrealistic for most Airbnb rentals in NYC.  \n",

    "- *Price*: The distribution is highly right-skewed. Most listings are priced below $200 per night, while a small number of properties are listed with significantly higher prices. This long tail confirms the presence of high-end outliers, which can distort average pricing metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Minimum Nights*: The vast majority of listings require fewer than 30 nights, with a sharp concentration around 1‚Äì5 nights. However, there are some listings with unusually high minimum night requirements, which are atypical for short-term rentals and likely represent special cases or data entry anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Number of Reviews*: The distribution is heavily skewed towards the lower end, with most listings receiving fewer than 50 reviews. Only a few listings accumulate more than 200 reviews, reflecting the fact that high-review listings are rare and typically represent long-standing or highly popular properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Reviews per Month*: Similar to the total reviews, this variable shows that most listings receive fewer than 2 reviews per month. A handful of listings report extremely high monthly reviews, which could indicate highly active or frequently booked properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Availability (365 Days)*: The distribution shows two strong peaks: one around very low availability (close to 0 days) and another around 365 days. This suggests a split behavior among hosts: some offer their listings only occasionally, while others keep them available year-round.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the results of our exploratory data analysis (EDA), several *actionable insights* can be derived from the NYC Airbnb dataset:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Neighborhood Dynamics*  \n",
    "   - Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the market, together hosting more than 80% of all listings.  \n",
    "   - Manhattan, in particular, exhibits significantly higher prices, making it a premium market compared to other boroughs.  \n",
    "   - Staten Island and Bronx, while less represented, provide more affordable alternatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Room Type Preferences*  \n",
    "   - Entire home/apartment listings account for the majority of revenue potential, given their higher prices.  \n",
    "   - Private rooms remain highly popular, offering affordability and accessibility to a larger customer base.  \n",
    "   - Shared rooms are the least common and cater to a niche audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Host Behavior*  \n",
    "   - The majority of hosts manage a single property, but a small group of multi-listing hosts control a disproportionately large share of listings.  \n",
    "   - This trend suggests the presence of professional operators within the Airbnb market in NYC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Availability Trends*  \n",
    "   - Many listings are either available year-round (365 days) or have very limited availability (close to 0 days), indicating two distinct host strategies:  \n",
    "     - Professional hosts maximizing occupancy.  \n",
    "     - Casual hosts offering their homes occasionally.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Pricing Patterns*  \n",
    "   - Extreme outliers (e.g., very high nightly rates) exist but are rare. Most prices cluster between $50‚Äì$200 per night.  \n",
    "   - Manhattan consistently has the highest average prices, particularly for entire homes/apartments.  \n",
